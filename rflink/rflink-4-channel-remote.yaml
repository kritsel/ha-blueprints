    # RF 4-channel remote control - via RFLink
    
    The RFLink integration creates a single HomeAssistant entity to represent each of the channels of 
    a multi-channel RF (Radia Frequency) remote control. Plus an additional entity to support the 'All' or 'Group'
    channel when the remote supports that.
    This basic behaviour allows you to switch ON or OFF four separate entities (or group of entities 
    when you use HomeAssistant's `group` feature) via HomeAssistant. 
    
    This blueprint adds more control possibilities. 
    It allows you to associate independent actions to the ON and OFF button for each channel. 
    This essentially turns your RF 4-channel remote control - meant to control *four* entities - 
    into an *eight* button remote control where the ON and OFF button for each channel can each trigger 
    a completely independent (set of) action(s). 
    
    ## Prerequisites
    
    * Your RF remote control MUST be integrated via the RFLink integration.
    * The RFLink configuration must include `fire_event: true` for all HomeAssistant entities that represent
    the channels.
    See https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rflink/ for guidance.
    
    Examples of RF remote controls which are expected to work with this blueprint:
    * COCO/KAKU APCR-2300R (https://klikaanklikuit.nl/product/stekkerschakelaarset-3-stekkers-2300-watt)
      (only has an ALL OFF button, no ALL ON)
    * COCO/KAKU AYCT-303 (https://klikaanklikuit.nl/product/afstandsbediening-met-wandplaat)
    
    ## 'All' or 'Group' functions
    The blueprint assumes that your RF remote control also supports an 'All' or 'Group' channel with an associated ON and
    OFF button. However, this functionality might not be available on every multi-channel remote control. 
    Some don't have an All/Group feature at all, or only have an OFF button for the 'All' channel and no ON.
