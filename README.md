My collection of HomeAssistant blueprints.

### RFlink switch/light blueprints

See this [post on Blueprints Exchange](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/blueprints-for-rf-radio-frequency-devices-integrated-via-rflink/939543)
for a description of the blueprints in the RFLink series.

### RFlink cover blueprints

These blueprints can be used to transform the remote controls you use to operate blindes/shades/curtains, etc.
(generically called 'covers' within the HomeAssistant universe) in general purpose remote controls.


Meaning that you can assign any kind of HomeAssistant action to the UP, STOP and DOWN commands.
